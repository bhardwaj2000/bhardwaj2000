## 💼 Professional Experience

**Java Developer, Infosys Pvt Ltd** (June 2022 - Present)
- Contributed to a large-scale enterprise project by developing and maintaining 12+ backend components, ensuring scalability and high availability. 
- Migrated legacy applications from Java 8 to Java 21 and refactored monolithic modules into microservices, improving maintainability and enabling independent deployments. 
- Designed and implemented REST-based microservices with MySQL and MongoDB integration, ensuring reliable and consistent data flow across applications. 
- Developed a Kafka-based event processing system for publishing and consuming messages, partitioning them into groups, and persisting them into databases to support business-critical operations. 
- Enhanced microservice performance with caching, exception handling, logging, and multithreading — reducing API response time and improving runtime efficiency. 
- Applied Spring Cloud, Service discovery and the Circuit Breaker design pattern to improve synchronous inter-service communication and fault tolerance. 
- Used Spring API Gateway for handling traffic, load balance in microservices. 
- Implemented the Saga orchestration pattern using Kafka, which is an effective way to manage distributed transactions and handle asynchronous communication between microservices. 
- Configured deployment properties (Helm, Dockerfile updates) and managed CI/CD releases through Jenkins and Harness, ensuring smooth deployments for all developed applications. 
- Optimized the end-to-end development process through Generative AI tools, applying advanced prompting techniques to accelerate bug fixing, feature enhancement, and test coverage for rapid, high quality releases. 
- Implement a centralized configuration management system using AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store to decouple secrets from source code, fetching real-time properties via AWS Client to improve deployment flexibility. 
- I focus strongly on code quality and coverage with JUnit, SonarQube, and Veracode, maintaining over 90% test coverage.
